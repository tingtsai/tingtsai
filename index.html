<p> ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ching-Ting <br>

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Electrophysiology, Nanofabrication, Bioelectronics, and Deep Learning <br>

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://cuilab.stanford.edu/">Prof. Bianxiao Cui's lab</a> at Stanford University. <br>


My research aims to ansewer key questions at the nano-bio interface, including protein sensing and cullular electrophysiology. <br>

As for the protein sensing direction, I spefically involve in engineering a in vitro nano-sensing platform for evaluating both positive and negative curvature sensing proteins. Recent work in the Cui Lab demonstrated that some proteins preferentially accumulate at nanostructure locations in a curvature-dependent manner, and this accumulation stimulates intracellular prcess such as actin polymerization and endocytosis. <br>

I also involve intensively in developing and characterizing high throughput electrophysiology tools including nanoelectrode array (NEA) and mesh electronics. We develop nanoscale electronics, minimally invasive, solid-state electrical probes to achieve high fidelity recording for cardiomyocytes and neurons. <br>

I was borned and raised in Taipei, Taiwan. I received my B.S. in Chemsitry from National Taiwan University in 2017. I partook research in Genomics Research Center at Academia Sinica to study sulfatase-1 inhibitor for osteoarthritis. My research advisor was Prof. Shang-Cheng Hung. <br>

I love scientific writing. I'm currently one of the writers for sciecntific news writing in <a href="https://investigator.tw/author/id0055/">The Investigator Taiwan</a><br>

I am an avid programmer. Check out some scripts I've written in my <a href="https://github.com/tingtsai">Github profile</a> <br>
