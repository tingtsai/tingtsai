<p> Hi, I’m <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ching-ting-tsai-6519b2187/">Ching-Ting Tsai</a> I’m currently a Ph.D. student in <a href="https://cuilab.stanford.edu/">Prof. Bianxiao Cui's lab</a> at  <a href="https://www.stanford.edu">Stanford University</a>. <br>
 <br>
 
 I’m interested in Electrophysiology, Nanofabrication, Bioelectronics, and Deep Learning. My research aims to answer key questions at the nano-bio interface, including protein sensing and cellular electrophysiology.

 I am an avid programming learner. You can find in my <a href="https://tingtsai.github.io/projects">Projects page</a> what I'm working on or interesting in, along with the relevant code on my <a href="https://github.com/tingtsai">Github profile</a>. <br>
